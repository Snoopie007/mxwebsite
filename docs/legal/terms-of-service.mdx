We describe the services provided when you sign up for an account with Us, define aspects of our business relationship, and set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access to and use of the websites, products, and services owned and operated by Us. Using our Subscription Services or signing up for Monstro indicates agreement with, and acceptance of, these Terms.

This is a legal contract, so if you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company, government agency, organization, or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such an entity to these Terms.

These Terms and our Privacy Policy may be amended at any time, with or without notice or notification, so we recommend periodically reviewing them, as continued use of the Site and/or Services indicates acceptance of the latest version of each. We also suggest printing or saving a local copy of these Terms, and the Privacy Policy for your records.

In this Agreement:
"Customer", "you" and "your" means the Customer; "Monstro", "Company", "we", "our" and "us" means 8BitApp LLC ("Monstro") and/or our authorized service providers.

You agree to pay all one-time and Subscription fees, including but not limited to fees based on Add-Ons, text message ("SMS") usage, email usage, pop-ups, and sticky bars in your Account, and all sub-accounts. Unless otherwise specified in a Subscription, such fees will be billed in advance for each month and are non-refundable. You agree that you may not be refunded or credited for partial months of service, or for periods in which your Account remains open but you do not use the Services. If you exceed any usage or fee thresholds outlined in your Subscription, we may charge you for such overages on your next invoice.

We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at time of renewal upon thirty (30) day's written notice by posting these fee changes to the Site or by notifying you via email. Should you continue to use the Services after these changes go into effect, you will be responsible for paying the new Subscription/billing rate.

By providing us with your credit card number, you agree that Monstro and our Third-Party service providers may store your payment card information. You expressly authorize us to charge you, where applicable: (i) Subscription Fees, to be billed during a Subscription Period (ii) other fees for Services purchased, including, but not limited to, Add-Ons, and (iii) taxes connected with your use of the Services.

You agree to reimburse us, where applicable, for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. If the payment card you provide expires and you do not update your payment card information or cancel your Subscription, you authorize us to suspend your Account until your billing details have been updated. After an Account suspension, you agree that we may re-attempt payment processing upon receiving updated billing details.

## 5. Term and Renewal

Your paid Subscription is valid for either a monthly or an annual Subscription Period. If you upgrade to a higher-level Subscription during the Subscription Period, you will have immediate access to those higher-level features. You agree to pay Monstro the difference between your original Subscription fee and the cost of the upgrade.

If you downgrade to a lower-level Subscription during the Subscription Period, you will receive a credit to your Account representing the difference between your original and your downgraded Subscription costs.

Changes to Subscriptions will be reflected in your next invoice. No credits or refunds will be issued for downgrading from a paid subscription to a Free Account (canceling).

Your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Period unless you cancel (see "Cancellation and Termination" below).

## 6. Termination & Cancellation

You ("The Customer") may cancel your monthly Subscription at any time, either from within your Account or by sending us an email ticket at support@mymonstro.com, stating the email address affiliated with your Account. Should you contact Customer Support to request assistance with Subscription Cancellation or account deletion, Monstro reserves the right to verify your identity by asking for the last four (4) digits of the credit card on file, the type of card, the billing address, and additional security questions.

To cancel over the phone, you must verify the last four (4) digits of the credit card on file, the type of card, and the billing address, as well as answer a series of security questions.

Cancellations must be completed at least one (1) day prior to the end of your then-current Subscription Period, whether monthly or annual; otherwise, billing for the next month or year will be processed automatically. Cancellations performed after billing are not entitled to refunds, in whole or in part.

You are responsible for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of Cancellation, including all fees within the Subscription Period in which you cancel. Upon Subscription Cancellation, you are placed on a Free Account, which Monstro shall delete within one (1) month of the date of Cancellation, unless you re-subscribe before the end of the 1-month period or make other arrangements with us to retain your Account and its affiliated Personal Data. Account deletion permanently removes all pages, popups, sticky bars, Content, and leads, as well as your email address and other Personal Data. Monstro is not responsible for any Content lost as a result of Account deletion. We reserve the right to change our data storage and processing capabilities and procedures at any time, without notice or liability, subject to applicable laws.

Monstro reserves the right to terminate this Agreement with 10 days notice, for cause, without liability. A reason for such termination may be, but is not limited to, failure to comply with these Terms. Monstro reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Site and/or Services, or any portion thereof, at any time and for any reason, with 30-days notice.

The sections "Submission of Content", "Intellectual Property Rights", "Confidential Information", "Third Party Sites and Content", "Disclaimer, Exclusion, and Limitation of Liability", "Indemnification", "Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action Rights", and "Dispute Resolution" will survive any actual or purported termination or expiry of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect.

Upon termination, Monstro will revert Customer's DNS setting to previous IP address.

## 7. Additional Locations and Fees

If the Customer wishes to add additional business locations under this Agreement, a fee of $299 per month will be charged for each additional location to cover the cost of software and services. For each additional location the Customer wishes to add under this Agreement, the Customer has the option to either:

- Pay a one-time fee of $150 to add a custom page for the new location to the existing website, plus $500 one-time fee for custom programming on existing software account, or
- Add a second website and software plan at a 30% discount under the same terms.

The choice between these options must be indicated by the Customer at the time of adding the additional location, and the applicable fee will be due immediately upon selection.

## 11. Exclusivity

Monstro agrees that, for the duration of this Agreement, it will not sell or provide its system, including SEO services, Google Business Profile optimization, AI and automation technology, CRM, and custom website services, to another customer operating in the same niche (e.g., Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Boxing, Karate, Taekwondo, Dance, Gymnastics schools) within a 5-mile radius of the Customer's primary business location. This exclusivity is intended to protect the Customer's competitive advantage in the local area and ensure that Monstro's services are uniquely tailored to the Customer's needs.

## 12. Confidentiality

Confidential information (the "Confidential Information") refers to any data or information relating to the business of the Customer which would reasonably be considered to be proprietary to the Customer including, but not limited to, accounting records, business processes, and Customer records and that is not generally known in the industry of the Customer and where the release of that Confidential Information could reasonably be expected to cause harm to the Customer.

The Company agrees that it will not disclose, divulge, reveal, report, or use, for any purpose, any confidential information that the Company has obtained, except as authorized by the Customer or as required by law. The obligations of confidentiality will apply during the term of this Agreement and will survive indefinitely upon termination of this Agreement.

All written and oral information and material disclosed or provided by the Customer to Monstro under this Agreement is Confidential Information regardless of whether it was provided before or after the date of this Agreement or how it was provided to Monstro.

## 13. Intellectual Property Rights

This section applies to Material and to Feedback, as defined above, and not to Customer leads or to Content created by the Customer.

We value our Customer, user, and potential Customer/user Feedback and take it very seriously, and we may, from time to time, solicit Feedback.

We may, in our sole discretion, use, share, or incorporate Feedback in whatever form or derivative we may decide into the Site, our software, Services, documentation, business, or other products, without limitation. We retain all rights to such Feedback on a worldwide basis in perpetuity.
